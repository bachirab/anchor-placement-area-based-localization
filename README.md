# Anchor Placement Area-based Localization

This code is the implementation of an optimal placement using Genetic algorithm.

To run simulation:

$python code.py parameters

For all code the parameters are:

--max_x: Give the MAX_X value

--max_y: Give the MAX_Y value

--points: Give the number points per side

--nb_anchors: Give the number of anchors

--seed: Give the seed value

--nb_ind: Give the number of individuals

--nb_gen: Give the number of generations

heuritic.py: is the implemntation of the proposed LSAAP heuristics.

genetic.py: is the implementation of the proposed GAAP (genetic).

brute_force.py: is the implementation of brute force.

analysis.py: is used to plot graphs and results summuries.
